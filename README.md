A simple Akamai EdgeWorker with Netacea built in.

## Running a sandbox

If you would like to run a sandbox please refer to the [official Akamai documentation](https://developer.akamai.com/tools/akamai-sandbox) where you can find proper instructions.

## Developer note

Sometimes, the sandbox doesn't immediately pickup the configuration from the remote - if you find your edgeworker is being ignored in the sandbox, try restarting your sandbox a few times.

## üíª Developing

If you need to extend or enhance the functionality of the Akamai EdgeWorker, the documentation can be found [here](https://developer.akamai.com/akamai-edgeworkers-overview).
Code extensions should be made in `./src/index.ts`.

Please ensure that as a minumum your `onClientRequest` handler contains:

```javascript
await worker.requestHandler(request)
```

and your `onClientResponse` handler contains:

```javascript
 await worker.responseHandler(request, response)
```

## Creating the Akamai Bundle

The edgeworker requires a code bundle with a main.js file and a bundle.js that defines the version.

A ZIP bundle is attached to each
[release](https://github.com/Netacea/akamai-edgeworker-template-typescript/releases)
in this repository.

To create this ZIP file yourself, using the latest version of the `@netacea/akamai` package, run:

```bash
npm ci
npm run bundle
```
