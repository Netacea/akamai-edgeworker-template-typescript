A simple Akamai EdgeWorker with Netacea built in.

## üí° Getting Started

In order to properly deploy Netacea Akamai integration it is required to create EdgeWorker ID and properly configure Property within a group.

1. Akamai EdgeWorker - Create an EdgeWorker ID
    a. Name could be whatever fits your needs. 
    b. In the Group selection select one where you will have property to set up for this integration.
    c. It is important that the worker is resource tier 200, i.e. Dynamic Compute. The lower resource tier is not sufficient for our needs.
2. Akamai Property Configuration
    a. Variables
    * PMUSER_NETACEA_API_KEY - Initial Value should contain api key; Security: Sensitive
    * PMUSER_NETACEA_SECRET_KEY - Initial Value should contain secret key; Security: Sensitive
    * PMUSER_CLIENT_IP - you can leave it blank; Security: Visible
    
    b. New Rule: EdgeWorker
    * Criteria
        * If: 
            * Request Header: "X-Netacea-ProxyPass" is not one of: "ingest" "mitigation"
            * NOTE: We skip the EdgeWorker on subrequests destined for the Mitigation or Ingest service. 
    * Behaviors
        * Set Variable
            * Variable: PMUSER_CLIENT_IP 
            * Create Value From: Expression
            * Expression: {{builtin.AK_CLIENT_REAL_IP}}
            * Operation: None
        * EdgeWorkers
            * Enbable: ON

##### ‚úîÔ∏è Akamai configuration finished!
Now you are almost ready to deploy the code the Akamai.
What's left is running `npm install` and setting the configuration file.

## Running a sandbox
Note: This container assumes you already have a `.edgerc` file at `${env:HOME}${env:USERPROFILE}/.edgerc`, configured per the [Akamai Documentation](https://developer.akamai.com/api/getting-started#edgercfile).

- Run `akamai install sandbox` to install the tooling
- Run `akamai sandbox create --name YOUR-SANDBOX-NAME --hostname www.yourhostname.com` to create the sandbox
  - NB: This requires you to have a property setup already with this hostname
- Run `akamai sandbox start` to run the sandbox, which will be available on port `9550`
- Update yout `hosts` file to point `www.yourhostname.com` at `127.0.0.1`

## Setting up an edgeworker and assigning to the property - Console
- Create and edgeworker ID
  - Open Edgeworkers Management
  - Click 'Create EdgeWorker ID'
  - Give the Edgeworker a name, assign it to the group containing your property, and give it the `Dynamic Compute` Resource tier.
  - Set the npm `package.json` with the edgeworker ID
- Setup Akamai property configuration
  - Open the property
  - Create or Select your property version
  - Add a Rule
    - Critera: Add any filtering you want to paths which the edgeworker should apply to
    - Behaviors: 
        - Add the "Allow POST" behavior
        - Edgeworkers: Enable, and select the idenfier of your new edgeworker.
- Push property configuration to your sandbox
  - Click the "Push to Sandbox" button in the header of "Property Configuration Settings"
  - Select your sandbox

## Setting up an edgeworker and assigning to the property - CLI
TODO: Need to investigate this

## Deploying the worker to your sandbox

- Run `npm run bundle` to create your bundled webworker
- TODO: Create a bundle.json in a nice way
- Run `akamai sandbox add-edgeworker $EDGEWORKER_ID ./bundle/edgeworker.tgz` to add the bundle to the sandbox
- Run `akamai sandbox start`

## Updating the worker on your sandbox

- Run `npm run bundle` to create your bundled webworker
- TODO: Create a bundle.json in a nice way
- Run `akamai sandbox update-edgeworker $EDGEWORKER_ID ./bundle/edgeworker.tgz` to update the bundle on the edgeworker
- Run `akamai sandbox start`

## Developer note

Sometimes, the sandbox doesn't immediately pickup the configuration from the remote - if you find your edgeworker is being ignored in the sandbox, try restarting your sandbox a few times.

## üíª Developing
If you need to extend or enhance the functionality of the Akamai EdgeWorker, the documentation can be found [here](https://developer.akamai.com/akamai-edgeworkers-overview).
Code extensions should be made in `./src/index.ts`.

Please ensure that as a minumum your `onClientRequest` handler contains:
```javascript
await worker.requestHandler(request)
```
and your `onClientResponse` handler contains:
```javascript
 await worker.responseHandler(request, response)
```
## ‚òÅ Deploying
__TODO__: Which command in Akamai? 
`npm run publish` is your friend. This will publish to your cloudfront distribution using serverless
