A simple Akamai EdgeWorker with Netacea built in.

## ‚ùó Note
Currently we have a workaround in place to get around some rollup issues. We generate the main.js that will ultimately go in the bundle and then do some string replacements to get the code in the state we want. This is overly brittle and will look to amend with a better solution asap. The work around can be found in rollup.config.js lines 22-25 and lines 30-31.

## Running a sandbox
If you would like to run a sandbox please refer to the [official Akamai documentation](https://developer.akamai.com/tools/akamai-sandbox) where you can find proper instructions.

## Developer note

Sometimes, the sandbox doesn't immediately pickup the configuration from the remote - if you find your edgeworker is being ignored in the sandbox, try restarting your sandbox a few times.

## üíª Developing
If you need to extend or enhance the functionality of the Akamai EdgeWorker, the documentation can be found [here](https://developer.akamai.com/akamai-edgeworkers-overview).
Code extensions should be made in `./src/index.ts`.

Please ensure that as a minumum your `onClientRequest` handler contains:
```javascript
await worker.requestHandler(request)
```
and your `onClientResponse` handler contains:
```javascript
 await worker.responseHandler(request, response)
```

## Creating the Akamai Bundle
The edgeworker requires a code bundle with a main.js file and a bundle.js that defines the version. You need to have created a src/config.js file with your configuration details. Then update the bundle.js with an appropriate version and description for your bundle. Finally run the following commands at the root level of this repository.

```bash
npm i
npm run ewbundle
```
