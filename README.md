A simple Akamai EdgeWorker with Netacea built in.

## ‚ùó Note
Currently we have a workaround in place to get around some rollup issues. We generate the main.js that will ultimately go in the bundle and then do some string replacements to get the code in the state we want. This is overly brittle and will look to amend with a better solution asap. The work around can be found in rollup.config.js lines 22-25 and lines 30-31.

## üí° Getting Started

In order to properly deploy Netacea Akamai integration it is required to create EdgeWorker ID and properly configure Property within a group.

1. Akamai EdgeWorker - Create an EdgeWorker ID
    a. Name could be whatever fits your needs. 
    b. In the Group selection select one where you will have property to set up for this integration.
    c. It is important that the worker is resource tier 200, i.e. Dynamic Compute. The lower resource tier is not sufficient for our needs.
2. Akamai Property Configuration
    a. Variables
    * PMUSER_NETACEA_API_KEY - Initial Value should contain api key; Security: Sensitive
    * PMUSER_NETACEA_SECRET_KEY - Initial Value should contain secret key; Security: Sensitive
    * PMUSER_CLIENT_IP - you can leave it blank; Security: Visible
    * PMUSER_NETACEA_MITIGATION_TYPE - Initial Value should be set to MITIGATE or INJECT or INGEST; Security: Visible
    * PMUSER_NETACEA_INGEST_TYPE - Initial Value should be HTTP; Security: Visible
    
    b. New Rule: EdgeWorker
    * Criteria
        * If: 
            * Request Header: "X-Netacea-ProxyPass" is not one of: "ingest" "mitigation"
            * NOTE: We skip the EdgeWorker on subrequests destined for the Mitigation or Ingest service. 
    * Behaviors
        * Set Variable
            * Variable: PMUSER_CLIENT_IP 
            * Create Value From: Expression
            * Expression: {{builtin.AK_CLIENT_REAL_IP}}
            * Operation: None
        * EdgeWorkers
            * Enbable: ON
            * Identifier: here you select EdgeWorker ID that you have created in step 1

##### ‚úîÔ∏è Akamai configuration finished!
Now you are almost ready to deploy the code the Akamai.
What's left is running `npm install` and setting the configuration file.

## Running a sandbox
If you would like to run a sandbox please refer to the [official Akamai documentation](https://developer.akamai.com/tools/akamai-sandbox) where you can find proper instructions.

## Developer note

Sometimes, the sandbox doesn't immediately pickup the configuration from the remote - if you find your edgeworker is being ignored in the sandbox, try restarting your sandbox a few times.

## üíª Developing
If you need to extend or enhance the functionality of the Akamai EdgeWorker, the documentation can be found [here](https://developer.akamai.com/akamai-edgeworkers-overview).
Code extensions should be made in `./src/index.ts`.

Please ensure that as a minumum your `onClientRequest` handler contains:
```javascript
await worker.requestHandler(request)
```
and your `onClientResponse` handler contains:
```javascript
 await worker.responseHandler(request, response)
```
